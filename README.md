<h1>🚀 Process</h1>
This portfolio website was built with a clear emphasis on modern design, usability, and a smooth user experience. I started by designing the layout using HTML5 for structure and CSS3 for styling, incorporating media queries to ensure full responsiveness on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. The layout was tested across different screen sizes to maintain a seamless experience.

JavaScript was used to introduce dynamic features like smooth scrolling navigation, hover animations, and interactive content display, especially in the project section. For example, the "Projects" grid showcases my work in a highly visual manner with hover effects that change background colors and elevate the project cards.

Throughout development, I iterated on different design ideas, adjusting margins, experimenting with CSS transitions and keyframe animations to create subtle, polished effects like the shaking headshot animation and button hover states. I took special care to balance creative flair with professional presentation, ensuring that each section, from the "About Me" to the "Contact" section, is both visually engaging and user-friendly, allowing visitors to navigate my work with ease.

<h1>🌟 Future Plans</h1>
Looking ahead, I plan to enhance my portfolio website by integrating additional features that will make it even more interactive and informative. One of the key updates will be an AI chatbot 🤖 that allows users to ask questions about my projects and receive real-time answers. This chatbot will provide deeper insights into my work, helping users better understand the technologies I’ve used and the challenges I’ve overcome. Additionally, I aim to include a blog 📝 feature where I can share live updates, write about my ongoing projects, and post about the latest trends in web development and technology. This blog will serve as a platform to engage with visitors, allowing them to follow my journey and stay updated on my work.
