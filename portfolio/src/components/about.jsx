            <div className="flex-col gap-5">
                   <p>I’m Taylor Pitman — front-end developer with a passion for clean code, sharp UI, and seamless UX. Based in New York, building for the web everywhere.</p>

                   <p>
                    What do I actually do? I take your clunky, confusing interfaces and turn them into responsive, accessible experiences that work — not just look nice in a mockup.
                    Most designers can’t code. Most developers can’t design. I live in the overlap. While others debate pixel margins, I’m shipping fast, intuitive interfaces that hit 
                    both performance and accessibility benchmarks. WCAG compliance? Non-negotiable.
                   </p>

                    <p>
                    I’ve built full-stack platforms, rebranded client websites, and even designed an AI-powered portfolio assistant — all from scratch. When I say I understand both front-end and backend, I mean I’ve deployed it.
                    The result? Interfaces that not only impress — they convert.
                    </p>

                    <p>Outside of code, you’ll find me lifting at the gym, reading fantasy novels, or tweaking layouts for fun. I’ll take a hot chocolate over coffee any day.</p>

                    <p>I don’t just build websites. I build web experiences that work.</p>
